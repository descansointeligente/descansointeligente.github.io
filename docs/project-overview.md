# Project Overview: Descanso Inteligente

## Purpose
**Descanso Inteligente** is a niche content website focused on ergonomics and rest (specifically coccyx cushions and orthopedic seats). 
- **Goal**: Generate affiliate income via **Amazon Associates**.
- **Strategy**: Creating high-quality, SEO-optimized content to rank for specific keywords (e.g., "cojín coxis teletrabajo", "mejor cojín ortopédico").

## Technical Architecture
The project is built as a **Static Site** (HTML/CSS/JS) hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

### Why this stack?
- **Performance**: Static HTML loads instantly, which is a key ranking factor for Google (Core Web Vitals).
- **Simplicity**: No build steps, backend servers, or complex dependencies to maintain.
- **Cost**: Free hosting on GitHub Pages.

### Key Components
- **HTML**: Semantic structure optimized for SEO (proper headings, meta tags, schema.org data).
- **CSS**: Custom design system (variables, responsive layout) without heavy frameworks (like Bootstrap) to keep the bundle size small.
- **JS**: Minimal vanilla JavaScript for interactions (mobile menu, scroll effects) to avoid blocking the main thread.

## Affiliate & Legal
- The site includes the required **Amazon Affiliate Disclaimer** on all pages.
- It complies with GDPR/RGPD with specific pages for Privacy Policy, Cookies, and Legal Notice.

## Development Guidelines
- **Mobile First**: Google indexes the mobile version of the site first. Ensure all features work perfectly on mobile.
- **Speed**: Avoid adding heavy libraries or large unoptimized images.
- **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels where necessary (e.g., mobile menu).
